}
```

## Rationale for Name Choice

**WorkPath** was chosen because:

1. **Positive and Empowering**: Suggests a journey/path rather than obligation
2. **Concise**: Short enough for app icons (8 characters)
3. **Memorable**: Easy to say and remember
4. **Stigma-Free**: No negative connotations
5. **Brandable**: Works well as a distinct brand identity
6. **Flexible**: Broad enough to cover work, volunteer, and education

The tagline "Your Work Requirements Assistant" provides clarity while the full description explicitly mentions all three activity types (work, volunteer, education) and both benefit programs (Medicaid and SNAP).
