## Readability Analysis

### Before Changes

- Some questions used legal/technical terms: "postpartum", "non-MAGI", "incarcerated", "medically frail"
- Help text was sometimes vague: "Tap the info icon below for details"
- Formal tone: "You are...", "You do not..."

### After Changes

- All questions use everyday language
- Help text provides context and examples
- Conversational tone: "You're...", "You don't..."
- Specific timeframes and criteria included
- Plain language alternatives for acronyms: "food stamps (SNAP)", "cash assistance (TANF)"

### Reading Level

- Estimated reading level: 6th-8th grade
- Average sentence length: 10-15 words
- Common, everyday vocabulary
- Active voice throughout
- Contractions used for conversational tone

---

## Integration with Definitions

All questions properly reference definitions through the `questionDefinitionMap` in `definitions.ts`:

- ✅ Age questions → No definitions needed (straightforward)
- ✅ Family questions → postpartum, dependentChild13OrYounger, caretakerRelative, dependent
- ✅ Health questions → medicare, nonMAGIMedicaid, disabledVeteran, medicallyFrail (and sub-categories)
- ✅ Program questions → snap, tanf, communityEngagement, drugAlcoholRehabProgram
- ✅ Other questions → inmate, indianUrbanIndianCaliforniaIndian, ihsEligible

Definitions are displayed via tooltips when users tap info icons, providing additional context without cluttering the main question text.

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. ✅ Read all questions aloud - do they sound natural?
2. ✅ Check that help text provides useful context
3. ✅ Verify definitions appear when tapping info icons
